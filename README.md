The KerMor-based biomechanical FEM suite

This software is under active development and neither do we provide up-to-date documentation or product support. This is intended for academic use ONLY.

However, if you are interested in using this software:
You'll also need the [KerMor](https://github.com/KerMor) repositories for anything to work.
See also the [KerMor Documentation](http://www.morepas.org/software/kermor/).

Happy simulating!
